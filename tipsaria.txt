Steps to Implement Random Image Selection
Prepare Your Images:

Place all the images you want to use in a specific folder within your Ren'Py project. For example, you might have a folder named images.
Define the Function:

In your script, you can define a function that selects a random image from the folder. Here’s a sample code snippet:
init python:
    import os
    import random

    def get_random_image():
        # Specify the folder containing your images
        image_folder = "images"
        # List all files in the folder
        images = [f for f in os.listdir(image_folder) if f.endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]
        # Select a random image
        return os.path.join(image_folder, random.choice(images))
Display the Image:

You can then use this function to display a random image in your game. For example:
label start:
    $ random_image = get_random_image()
    show expression random_image
    "Here is a random image!"
Explanation of the Code
os: This module is used to interact with the operating system, allowing you to list files in a directory.
random: This module is used to select a random item from a list.
get_random_image(): This function lists all images in the specified folder and returns a random image path.
Additional Tips
Make sure your images are in the correct format (like .png, .jpg, etc.) as specified in the code.
You can call get_random_image() whenever you want to display a new random image.
This method is quite flexible and can be adapted to suit your needs! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask! 😊
